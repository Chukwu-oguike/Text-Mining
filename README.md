# Text-Mining

The goal of this project is to detect and output within-text data citations in scientific research articles using NLP methods. The results from this project can show how public data are being used in science and help the policy makers make wiser, more transparent public investments. It will help move researchers and governments from using ad-hoc methods to automated ways of finding out what datasets are being used to solve problems, what measures are being generated, and which researchers are the experts
